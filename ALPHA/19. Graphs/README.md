### Graphs

#### storing a graph
- **Adjacency List**
- Adjacency Matrix
- Edge List
- 2D Matrix (Implicit Graph)

#### Graph Traversal
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)

- hasPath (for given  src & dest, tell if a path exists from src to dest)

#### Cyle Detection
- Undirected Graph

#### Bipartite Graph

### cyle Detection in Directed Graph
- DFS

#### Topological Sort
- DFS
- BFS (Kahn's Algorithm)

#### All paths from source to destination

#### Shortest Path from the source to all other nodes
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Bellman Ford Algorithm (for negative edges)

#### Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

- Prim's Algorithm
