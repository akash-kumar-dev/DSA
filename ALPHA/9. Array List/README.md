 # Array list

 ### 1. Basics
 ### 2. Multi Dimensional Array list
 ### 3. Store Water Problem
 ```
for given n lines on x-axis use 2 lines to form a container such that it holds maximum water.
height[] = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,5,7] -> 49
 ```
- Bruteforce Method (O(n^2))
- Two pointer Approach (O(n))

### 4. pair Sum 1

```
find if any pair in a sorted Arraylist has a target sum
list = [1.2.3.4.5], target = 5

```
- Two Poiner Method

### 5. pair sum2

```
find if any pair in a sorted & rotated Array list has a target sum
list = [11,15,6,8,9,10], target = 16

```
- modified Two Poiner Method with Modular Arithmatic
