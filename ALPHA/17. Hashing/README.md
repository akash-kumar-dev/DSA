## hashmap

### iteration over hashmap

### implementation of hashmap
- hashmap is a data structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookup.
- Hashmap implementation typically uses an array of linked lists (buckets) for efficient collision resolution.
- for every bucket, the key value pair stored in the LinkedList.

```Note:
worst case tieme complexity of hashmap is O(n) in case of if all the keys are hashed to the same bucket.
```

### LinkedHashMap
- keys are stored in the order they were inserted. (O(1))

### TreeMap
- keys are sorted in ascending order. (O(logn))

### Majority Element
- majority element is the element that appears more than n/3 times in the array.

### Valid Anagram
- two strings are anagrams if they have the same characters but in a different order.

## Hash Set
- no duplicates (unique elements)
- no order
- NULL is allowed

### Iteration over HashSet

### LinkedHashSet and TreeSet

### unique and Intersection of two arrays

### find Itinerary from Tickets

### Largest subArray with zero sum

### subArray sum equal to k
