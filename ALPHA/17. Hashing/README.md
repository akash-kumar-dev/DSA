#### hashmap

### iteration over hashmap

### implementation of hashmap
- hashmap is a data structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookup.
- Hashmap implementation typically uses an array of linked lists (buckets) for efficient collision resolution.
- for every bucket, the key value pair stored in the LinkedList.

```Note:
worst case tieme complexity of hashmap is O(n) in case of if all the keys are hashed to the same bucket.
```
