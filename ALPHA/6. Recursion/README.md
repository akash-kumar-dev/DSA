# Recursion

Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to <b>smaller instannces of same problem.<b>

### 2-RecursionBasic2.java

    power of x ^ n -> Time compl. -> O(n)

    Optimized power calculation with T.C. O(logn)

### 3-TilingProblem.java

    Given a "2*n" board(floor) and tiles of size "2*1",
    count the number of ways to tile the given board using the 2*1 tiles.
    (A tile can either be placed horizontally or vertically.)
